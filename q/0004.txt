reigning world champion under normal tournament conditions with
classical time controls?

The first game of the 1996 Kasparov-Deep Blue match, which took place
on 10 Feb 1996, marked the first time a computer defeated a reigning
world champion in a single game under normal tournament conditions
with classical time controls.  Kasparov eventually won the match 4–2,
but the first game of the 1996 match was a historic milestone in
computer chess.

Later, in the 1997 rematch held from 03 May to 11 May 1997, an
improved version of Deep Blue won 3&frac12;–2&frac12, becoming the
first computer to defeat a reigning world champion in a full match.

The other years mentioned in the quiz options are also notable in the
development of computer programs playing board games against humans.

In 1948, Alan Turing and David Champernowne developed a chess program
known as <em>Turochamp</em>.  The name comes from the surnames of the
two inventors.  The program was not implemented on an actual computer
during Turing's lifetime.  However, it was used to play against humans
by simulating the algorithm on paper.

In 1956, <em>Los Alamos chess</em> became the first program to play a
chess-like game.  Los Alamos chess is a variant of chess played without
bishops on a 6×6 board.  The program was written at Los Alamos
Scientific Laboratory by Paul Stein and Mark Wells for the
Mathematical Analyser Numerical Integrator and Automatic Computer
Model I (MANIAC I).

On 09 Mar 2016, a computer program named AlphaGo, developed by
DeepMind (a British AI company acquired by Google in 2014), won a game
against Lee Sedol and became the first program to defeat a human
professional Go player on a full-sized 19x19 board without
handicaps.  In the five-game match between AlphaGo and Sedol, held
until 15 Mar 2016, AlphaGo won 4–1.
