If a floppy disk manufacturer were to make a 3&frac12; inch floppy
disk case measuring exactly 3&frac12; by 3&frac12; inches, would it be
larger or smaller than the standard 3&frac12; inch floppy disk
specification?

Smaller

---

Larger

---

Exactly the same size as specified in the 3&frac12; inch floppy disk
specification

---

Cannot be determined

---

No such floppy disk specification exists

The ECMA-147 standard specifies that a 3&frac12; inch floppy disk case
must have an external height of 94.0 mm (&pm;0.3 mm) and an external
width of 90.0 mm (&plus;0.4 mm/&minus;0.1 mm).  The minimum permitted
height and width are therefore 93.7 mm and 89.9 mm respectively.
Converted to inches, these minimums are approximately 3.69 by 3.54
inches.  A case measuring exactly 3.5 by 3.5 inches would therefore be
smaller than the dimensions required by the standard.

The term '3&frac12; inch' is only a nominal size.  It does not
describe any physical measurement in the specification.  The actual
dimensions are defined entirely in millimetres.  As a result, the
actual size of the standard case differs from the nominal inch-based
designation.
