Latent strength

Trapezius

The term 'lat' is short for <em>latissimus dorsi</em>, a pair of
large, flat muscles on either side of the back.  The <em>lat
pull-down</em> is a seated exercise that targets the latissimus dorsi
by pulling a bar from above down to the upper chest, then slowly
extending the arms back to the starting position.  The latissimus
dorsi is also known as 'lats' among bodybuilders and gym-goers.

The <em>lateral deltoid</em> is one of the three heads of the deltoid
muscle.  It is located on the outer side of the shoulder and is
responsible for lifting the arm away from the body.  Exercises such as
lateral raises target this muscle.

The <em>trapezius</em> is a large, triangular muscle that extends from
the base of the skull down to the middle of the back.  It plays a key
role in moving, rotating and stabilising the shoulder blades.  Common
exercises targeting the trapezius include shrugs and upright rows.

<em>Lateral stabilisation</em> is a generic term with different
meanings depending on the field.  In human anatomy, it can refer to
the body's ability to maintain balance and control of side-to-side
movements. In construction and engineering, it can refer to the
capacity of a structure to resist horizontal forces such as wind or
seismic activity. This term is not directly related to the lat
pull-down exercise.

<em>Latent strength</em> is a pure distractor in the quiz options.  It
is not a recognised strength training concept, although it may be used
informally to describe untapped potential strength.
