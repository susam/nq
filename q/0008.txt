The <em>International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet</em> assigns a
unique word to each letter of the English alphabet to ensure clarity
in spoken communication, especially over radio or telephone, where
signals may be noisy or distorted.  It is the standard used by the
International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation (NATO) and several other organisations for
communication over radio or telephone.  Therefore, it is also commonly
known as the NATO spelling alphabet or the ICAO spelling alphabet.

In this alphabet, each letter of the alphabet is represented by a code
word.  The complete list of code words is: Alfa, Bravo, Charlie,
Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett, Kilo, Lima, Mike,
November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor,
Whiskey, Xray, Yankee, Zulu.

Golf is the only sport that appears in this list of code words.
