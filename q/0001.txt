---

An integral domain is a non-trivial commutative ring in which the
product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero.  Which of the
following statements is true?

---

Every finite integral domain is a field.

---

Every integral domain is a field.

---

Every infinite integral domain is a field.

---

All of the above.

---

None of the above.

Every infinite integral domain is not a field.  For example, the set
of all integers is an integral domain but it is not a field.  As a
result, every integral domain is not a field either.

In fact, every finite integral domain is a field.  This can be shown
as follows.

Let \( R \) be a finite integral domain.  Let \( a \in R \) such that
\( a \ne 0 \).  Consider the set
\[
  A = \{ a, a^2, a^3, \dots \}.
\]
Since a ring is closed under multiplication, every element of \( A \)
is also an element of \( R \).  Therefore \( A \subseteq R \).  Since
\( R \) is finite, \( A \) is finite too.  Therefore there must be
positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \gt n \) and
\[
  a^m = a^n
\]
From the above equation, we get
\[
  a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} \cdot a^n = 1 \cdot a^n.
\]
By the cancellation property of integral domain,
\[
  a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} = 1.
\]
Since a ring is closed under multiplication and since \( m - n - 1 \ge
0 \), we get \( a^{m - n - 1} \in R \).

Thus every non-zero \( a \in R \) has a multiplicative inverse in
\( R \).
