---

The national flags of Indonesia and Monaco are very similar, each
showing a red band over a white band.  What is the primary difference
between the two flags?

---

Their proportions differ.  Indonesia's is 2:3 but Monaco's is 4:5.

---

The shade of red differs.  Monaco's flag uses a darker shade of red.

---

One includes a coat of arms while the other does not.

---

One has a a white crescent moon facing a pentagon of five small white
five-pointed stars while the other does not.

---

None of the above.  Both flags are identical.

---

Although the flags of Indonesia and Monaco share a red-over-white
bicolour design and look very similar, the principal difference lies
in their proportions.  Indonesia specifies a ratio of 2:3 while Monaco
uses 4:5.  The shade of red does differ slightly.  Monaco's flag has a
darker shade of red.  However, the difference in proportion is the
definitive and formally specified distinction.

Neither flag includes a coat of arms or any other emblem.
Incidentally, the flag of Singapore also features a red-and-white
design, yet it is easily distinguished by its white crescent moon
facing a pentagon of five small white stars.
