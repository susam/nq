A <em>simple graph</em> is one in which no vertex is connected to
itself and no two vertices are joined by more than one edge.  In other
words, it has no loops or multiple edges.

An <em>undirected graph</em> is one in which edges have no direction.
An edge is represented simply as an unordered pair of vertices.

For a set of \( n \) vertices, each possible pair of distinct vertices
may either be connected by an edge or left unconnected.  The total
number of such pairs is given by the binomial coefficient
\[
  \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}.
\]
Each pair of vertices gives two possibilites: an edge present between
them or no edge at all.  Therefore the total number of distinct
simple, undirected graphs that can be formed with \( n \) vertices is:
\[
  2^{n(n - 1)/2}.
\]
This number represents all possible edge configurations in simple,
undirected graphs.  Such graphs can be used to model symmetric
relationships such as mutual friendships, research collaboration
networks and molecular structures.
