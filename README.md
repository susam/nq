Nerd Quiz
=========

**Nerd Quiz** is a simple HTML application that lets you test your
nerdiness through short quiz sets.  Each question is drawn from
everyday moments of reading, writing, thinking, learning and
exploring.

Sometimes, when I come across something curious or fascinating, I turn
it into a quiz question and share it here.  New quizzes are published
whenever I have five fresh questions ready.  There is no fixed
schedule.
